          MeanStreak began with a man and a dream.
        </p>
        <p class="body-1">
          Well not a dream per se. It's more like a man had a job that involved
          a lot of mindless tasks. While performing these mindless tasks, he
          daydreamed a lot, and these are some of the thoughts that ran through
          his head. They ran through his head so non-stop that he needed to find
          a way to get them out. Unable to afford professional therapy, he began
          drawing them. Once they were out, he got sick of looking at them by
          himself. If he had to suffer, that didn't mean he had to suffer alone.
          Misery loves company, as they say. And so, here is MeanStreak, for no
          one's pleasure.
